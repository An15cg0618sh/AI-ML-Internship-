Task 1 : The tasks focused on preparing the Titanic dataset for further analysis or modeling by ensuring data quality and exploring basic relationships between variables.

Tasks 2 : In Tasks 2, we performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. We started by loading the dataset and generating summary statistics to understand the central tendencies and spread of each feature. Then, we visualized the distributions of numeric features like Age and Fare using histograms and identified outliers using boxplots and also to make the visulizaton to look better we use Plotlib

Tasks 3: In Tasks 3, we performed  Linear Regression model to know MAE, MSE, R² using the dataset i.e "Home-Rent" and the machine as trained well showing the accuracy of learning through the R² value 
I have performed both way to learn the machine in both the way using simple and multiple  linear Regression model both the way of training and testing show that the model as achived the accuracy in excellent 

Tasks 4: In Task 4, we built and trained a logistic regression model to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, the model achieved 99% accuracy with excellent performance metrics, showing it learned to classify tumors very effectively.
